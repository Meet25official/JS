1. What is a variable in JavaScript?
-> A container for storing data values.
Explanation:
In JavaScript, a variable is a container used to store data values, such as numbers, strings, objects, or any other type of data.


2. What is the correct way to declare a variable in JavaScript?
-> var x = 10;
Explanation:
In JavaScript, variables are declared using the 'var' keyword, followed by the variable name and an optional initial value.


3. What is the result of the following code?
var x = 5;
var y = 10;
var result = x + y;
-> 15
Explanation:
The code declares two variables x and y with the values 5 and 10, respectively. Then, it assigns the sum of x and y to the variable result. The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.


4. Which of the following is NOT a valid variable name in JavaScript?
-> 1count
Explanation:
Variable names in JavaScript cannot start with a number. Therefore, 1count is not a valid variable name.

Variables Naming Conventions:

Use Camel Case

Begin with Letters, $, or _

Avoid Reserved Words

Be Descriptive

Don't Use Hyphens (-)

Case Sensitive

Avoid Global Variables


5. Which keyword is used to declare block-scoped variables in ES6?
->  let
Explanation:
In ES6, the let keyword is used to declare block-scoped variables that are limited to the block (enclosing curly braces) in which they are defined.


6. What is the difference between let and const in JavaScript?
-> let can be reassigned, while const is read-only and cannot be reassigned.
Explanation:
In JavaScript ES6, let allows variables to be reassigned with new values, while const declares read-only variables that cannot be reassigned once they are initialized.


7. What is the purpose of the const keyword in JavaScript?
-> To declare a constant value that cannot be changed after initialization.
Explanation:
The const keyword is used to declare a constant variable in JavaScript. Once a value is assigned to a const variable, it cannot be reassigned or changed throughout the program's execution.


8. What is the difference between declaring a variable with var and let?
-> var variables are limited to the block in which they are defined, while let variables are accessible throughout the entire function.
Explanation:
The difference lies in their scope. var variables are function-scoped, whereas let variables are block-scoped. var variables are accessible throughout the entire function in which they are defined, while let variables are limited to the block in which they are defined.


9. What will be the value of the variable result in the following code?
let value = 20;
if (value > 10) {
  var result = "Greater than 10";
  console.log(result);
} else {
  var result = "Less than or equal to 10";
  console.log(result);
}
-> "Greater than 10"
Explanation:
In this code, the if condition (value > 10) is true because value is 20, which is greater than 10. Therefore, the first var result declaration will be executed, resulting in the value "Greater than 10".


10. JavaScript variables are:
-> Case-sensitive
Explanation:
JavaScript variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that myVariable and myvariable are different variables.
